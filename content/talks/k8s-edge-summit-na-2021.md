## Open Networking & Edge Summit + Kubernetes on Edge Day NA 2021

*[Achieving Continuous Delivery of Multiple Helm Charts with Orkestra](https://sched.co/lStG)*

Mission-critical systems running a complex network of inter-dependent applications require reliable and robust lifecycle management. While CD helps automate the rollout and upgrade of standalone applications (charts), complex systems with hard dependencies between components require finer-grained control over their lifecycle. By leveraging popular CNCF projects (like Argo, Helm, FluxCD) Orkestra solves the dependency problem by providing users with the ability to: - Coordinate large-scale helm-chart-based deployments using DAG workflows - Perform zero downtime, in-service upgrades using: o Standard rollouts o Progressive rollouts using Automated Canary Analysis (with Flagger) o Custom rollout strategies, using BYO workflow executor container images - Perform auto-remediation and metric-driven rollbacks.
