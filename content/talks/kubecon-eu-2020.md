Most organizations use some flavor of multi-tenancy in their clusters for their teams, applications or customers. Namespaces paired with RBAC, ResourceQuota & NetworkPolicy provide ways to isolate tenants at some level. However these primitives are insufficient for setting L7 policies on the ingress/egress traffic per tenant.

If youâ€™re administering clusters for multiple tenants, attend this talk to learn a new model for deploying workloads in tenant specific sub-meshes within your service mesh. This model uses Envoy based ingress/egress gateways per-tenant, which helps:

- set traffic policies and scale resources per-tenant
- hide tenant application topology when communicating with external entities
- assign per-tenant identities (SPIFFE) for use with transport authentication (mTLS), authorization (OAuth2) & origin authentication (JWT)
- share mesh control plane resources across tenants
